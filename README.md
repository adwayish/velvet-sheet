#Velvet Experiment Sheet

<!--
### Motivation: 
 making a de novo assembly experiment usually several iteration with different parameters 
-->
 
[Velvet](https://github.com/dzerbino/velvet) is de novo assembler for NGS reads.
Influnced by [standardized-velvet-assembly-report](http://code.google.com/p/standardized-velvet-assembly-report/), 
velvet experiment sheet is a single [ipython notebook](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html) that can 
help you run multiple assemblies with differe parameters, and visualize the result. 

You can use it as your lab sheet that contains the tasks ( or commands) you used to generate the assembly, as well as the
analysis of the results. Also, You can add this sheet under source control and make different branches or keep history of your
analysis progress. All of this is possible thanks to the power and format of iPython notebook.
